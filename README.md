# Built with Phalcon

Gallery of applications, demos and projects built with Phalcon

https://builtwith.phalconphp.com

## Disclaimer
This site has been inspired by https://builtwith.angularjs.org/.
The github code has been forked and adapted to Phalcon.
Credits to the contributors of that project for their hard work.

## Adding your project
1. Decide on a project permalink. This will be the URL part and it has to be
unique. If someone else has reserved that name, you will need to choose another
one. Example names are: phalconphp-website, phalconphp-forum etc. Please use
only alphanumeric characters and dashes.
2. Fork this repository.
3. Add a 500 by 500px thumbnail image to `public/projects/[yourprojectnamehere]/thumb.png`
4. Add an entry to `app/var/projects.json` with properties (see below)
5. Send a pull request
