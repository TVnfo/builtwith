Your hardcore loop machine.

Giada is a free, minimal, hardcore audio tool for DJs, live performers and electronic musicians. How does it work? 
<!--more-->
Just pick up your channel, fill it with samples or MIDI events and start the show by using this tiny piece of software as a loop machine, drum machine, sequencer, live sampler or yet as a plugin/effect host. Giada aims to be a compact and portable virtual device for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows for production use and live sets.
